          <h2 class="headline">Humble Beginnings</h2>
          <p>In 2014, we set out to create a sports & fitness brand that would surpass all others. We aimed to create a "one-stop-shop" for all things fitness, health, and lifestyle. This meant creating an engaging community platform, quality nutritional supplement, unique apparel, and fitness advice backed by scientific data.</p>
          <p>Our quest started when our team began to search for the best place to find fitness advice, supplements, and branding. Not because we wanted to compete, but because we were actually looking for fitness advice! Here at Vault Sports, all of our team members are active members of the fitness community, so we came about by creating a solution to a problem. When we couldn't find an effective solution, we decided to create one.</p>
          <p>Today, our vision continues to stay steady, create the best sports and fitness brand that provides athletes of all types a home. At our foundation are a strong line of products that you can trust, and great people.</p>
